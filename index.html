        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>Standardization efforts to develop media foundations for the Web, such as the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#htmlmediaelement"><code>HTMLMediaElement</code></a> interface and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/">Media Source Extensions</a>, have helped turn the Web into a major platform for media streaming and media consumption. Building on the experience gained through implementation, deployment and usage of these technologies, and on incubation discussions within the <a href="https://wicg.io/">Web Platform Incubator Community Group</a>, the Media Working Group will extend media foundations with new standardized technologies to improve the overall media playback experience on the Web.</p>

        <p>The <b>scope</b> of the Media Working Group is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Detection of media capabilities</li>
          <li>Detection of the autoplay policy</li>
          <li>Statistics on perceived playback quality</li>
          <li>Generation of media streams for playback</li>
          <li>Playback of encrypted content</li>
          <li>Exposure of media features at the system level (e.g. access to platform media keys, display of media metadata at the system level, creation of an <em>always-on-top</em> video window) to Web applications</li>
          <li>Exposure of metadata event tracks synchronized to audio or video media</li>
        </ul>

        <section id="section-out-of-scope">
          <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
          <p>The following features are <b>out of scope</b>, and will not be addressed by the Media Working Group:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The definition of any new codecs for audio and video</li>
            <li>The definition of adaptive streaming mechanisms (but the group will develop mechanisms that enable/ease the implementation of such mechanisms within Web applications)</li>

The scope of this revision is the same as that of the <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/'>W3C Recommendation published in November 2016</a>, limited to the generation and control of media streams. This revision updates the W3C Recommendation to address maintenance issues against the specification and add the <a href="https://github.com/wicg/media-source/blob/codec-switching/codec-switching-explainer.md">codec switching</a> feature incubated in the Web Platform Incubator Community Group since then. Additional features that are strictly in the scope of this specification may be considered.</p>

This revision updates the <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/encrypted-media/'>W3C Recommendation published in September 2017</a> to address maintenance issues against the specification and add three minor features incubated in the Web Platform Incubator Community Group since then, namely: <a href="https://github.com/WICG/hdcp-detection/blob/master/explainer.md">HDCP Detection</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WICG/encrypted-media-encryption-scheme/blob/master/explainer.md">Encryption scheme capability detection</a> and an API to <a href="https://github.com/joeyparrish/encrypted-media-find-session">find existing sessions</a>. The inclusion of other features is considered out of scope for this group and would require rechartering.</p>

          <h3>Potential Normative Specifications</h3>
          <p>The following features have been identified as potential normative specifications and may be adopted as normative specifications by the Working Group if there is consensus in the group that they are ready to move to the Recommendation track:</p>
          <dl>
            <dt><a href="https://github.com/WICG/audio-focus/blob/master/explainer.md">Audio Focus API</a></dt>
            <dd>An API to allow web applications to manage their audio focus, to improve the audio-mixing of websites with native apps so they can play on top of each other or play exclusively.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://github.com/WICG/datacue/blob/master/explainer.md">DataCue</a></dt>
            <dd>An API to support metadata event tracks, carried either in-band or out-of-band and synchronized to audio or video media, which are used to support use cases such as ad insertion or presentation of supplemental content alongside the audio or video. This includes the possible adoption of the <a href="https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-sourcing-inband-tracks/">Sourcing In-band Media Resource Tracks from Media Containers into HTML</a> document to specify the handling of in-band events.</dd>
            <dt>Stream format specifications and accompanying registries</dt>
            <dd>Notes described in <a href="#other-deliverables">Other Deliverables</a> define optional features for Media Source Extensions and Encrypted Media Extensions. The Working Group may move them to the Recommendation track.</dd>
          </dl>

          <p>The Working Group will not adopt these features until they have matured through the <a href="https://wicg.io/">Web Platform Incubator Community Group</a> or another similar incubation phase. If additional normative specifications need to be added to the Charter before the Charter expires, the Working Group will recharter with changes.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="other-deliverables">
          <h3>Other Deliverables</h3>
          <p>The Media Working Group will maintain non-normative stream format specifications for Media Source Extensions and Encrypted Media Extensions, develop new stream format specifications, and update corresponding registries. It will maintain the following Notes in particular:</p>

        <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
        <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>
        <p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users, including analysis of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/fingerprinting-guidance/">fingerprinting surface introduced</a> and suggested mitigation strategies, as applicable. Where features are imported by reference to other specifications, analysis and mitigation of their privacy and security issues will be included the referencing specification.</p>
        <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
        <p>Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations. The latest versions of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/media-accessibility-reqs/">Media Accessibility User Requirements</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/apa/fast/">Framework for Accessible Specification of Technologies (FAST)</a> documents notably provide media related advice to ensure that specifications developed by the Working Group meet the needs of users with disabilities.</p>
        <p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">tests</a>.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a>
          for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>. The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.

        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/media-wg/">Media Working Group home page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Media Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/media-wg/issues">GitHub issues</a>. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
