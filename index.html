        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>Standardization efforts to develop media foundations for the Web, such as the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#htmlmediaelement"><code>HTMLMediaElement</code></a> interface and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/">Media Source Extensions</a>, have helped turn the Web into a major platform for media streaming and media consumption. Building on the experience gained through implementation, deployment and usage of these technologies, and on incubation discussions within the <a href="https://wicg.io/">Web Platform Incubator Community Group</a>, the Media Working Group will extend media foundations with new standardized technologies to improve the overall media playback experience on the Web.</p>

        <p>The <b>scope</b> of the Media Working Group is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Detection of media capabilities</li>
          <li>Detection of the autoplay policy</li>
          <li>Statistics on perceived playback quality</li>
          <li>Generation of media streams for playback</li>
          <li><ins><span title="Sample 2">②</span>Playback of encrypted content <span title="Sample 3">③</span><span title="Sample 2">②</span></li>
          <li>Exposure of media features at the system level to Web applications (e.g. access to platform media keys, display of media metadata at the system level, creation of an <em>always-on-top</em> video window) to Web applications</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The following features are <b>out of scope</b>, and will not be addressed by the Media Working Group:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><del><span title="Sample 2">②</span>Playback of encrypted content <span title="Sample 3">③</span><span title="Sample 2">②</span></li>
          <li>The definition of any new codecs for audio and video</li>
          <li>The definition of adaptive streaming mechanisms (but the group will develop mechanisms that enable/ease the implementation of such mechanisms within Web applications)</li>
        </ul>

        <section id="success">
          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>
          <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
          <p><ins><span title="Sample 3">③</span> If a specification updates Encrypted Media Extensions (EME), it must include provisions to protect investigation and disclosure of security vulnerabilities in implementations or use of EME, on a worldwide basis. For instance, it might do so by specifying that implementations must not be construed as technological measures or interfaces to technical protection measures as defined in DMCA Section 1201 or similar copyright laws in other jurisdictions. Alternatively, it might link to individual statements of intent, signed by Working Group participants and other companies, to permanently exempt investigation and disclosure of security vulnerabilities from aforementioned copyright laws. A third possibility would be to refine and have Working Group participants adopt <a href="https://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/2017/SUBM-sdbp-20170302/">Security Disclosures Best Practices</a>. An EME specification must not advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR">Candidate Recommendation</a> or beyond without satisfactory protection for research and disclosure. <span title="Sample 3">③</span></ins></p>
          <p>Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations. Each specification should notably meet media related requirements specified in the latest versions of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/media-accessibility-reqs/">Media Accessibility User Requirements</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/apa/fast/">Framework for Accessible Specification of Technologies (FAST)</a> documents.</p>
          <p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href="https://github.com/w3c/testing-how-to/#test-as-you-commit">tests</a>.</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.

          Communication
        </h2>
        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <span class="todo"><a href="">Media Working Group home page</a></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Media Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on <span class="todo"><a id="public-github" href="[link to Github repo]">GitHub issues</a></span>. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
